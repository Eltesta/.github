ELTESTA is a company which designs and manufacturers an extensive line of high-performance electronic equipment based on Time-Domain Technologies in Pico- and Nanosecond Areas. The key point of these technologies is generating and acquiring electrical and optical signals with very fast rise time.

Main components of these instruments built under these technologies are:

- Wide-bandwidth samplers,
- Finite pulse generators,
- Microwave accessories.
All they used very fast semiconductors.

Line of the instruments includes:

- Digital storage oscilloscopes with bandwidth up to 16 GHz.
- Sampling oscilloscopes also working as Communication Analysers and Time Domain Reflectometers with bandwidth up to 25 GHz.
- Pulse and Step Generators with rise time from 35 ps @ 200 mV up to 60 ps @ 6 V.
Our products serve a vast number of markets, including the high frequency telecommunication industry, semiconductors testing, electronic test instrumentation, computers, aerospace, research, military, among others. Many of the products are the key components of T&M systems, which work in pico- and nanosecond data acquisition systems. In some application they are using as calibrators.

ELTESTA’s designing and manufacturing process utilizes highly skilled assemblers and quality assurance testing. All operations are performed in-house laboratories, including product design, assembly, final test and calibration. Product design relies heavily on computer-aided design programs.

ELTESTA is a company, committed to fulfilling of our customer’s metrological, technological and other requirements. We custom design products to meet customer specification. Contrary to industry standards, our published specifications are explicitly detailed. ELTESTA markets its products direct, and through a network of sales representatives.

ELTESTA was founded as a company in 1993. Today ELTESTA is a joint-stock company with mixed shares capital.

The name of company was derived of two words – ELECTRONICS and TESTING, i.e. ELTESTA.
